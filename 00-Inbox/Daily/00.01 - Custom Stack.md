Layer,Component,Config File,Purpose
1. The Orchestrator,Aerospace,aerospace.toml,"Controls where you work. It forces specific apps into specific workspaces (e.g., Terminal in WS1, Browser in WS2) to reduce cognitive load."
2. The Engine,Neovim,"lazy.lua, plugins/*.lua","The core interface. It handles code editing, Git operations (lazygit), and testing (neotest)."
3. The Brain,Obsidian,knowledge.lua,"Stores your ""external memory."" It uses the Johnny Decimal system to organize logs, notes, and project data."
4. The Bridge,Custom Logic,devops-workflow.lua,"This is the secret sauce. It connects the Engine to the Brain, allowing you to create logs and incident reports without leaving the editor."
