# Sats Guide

🕵️ The Invisible SATs Guide: Logistics & Mindset
For Parents & Students | Spring 2026

1. 🐣 The Easter Holiday Deal (April 3rd – 19th)
Avoid the "holiday battle" by agreeing to these rules now.

The "Morning Power Hour": All revision must be done between 09:00 AM – 10:30 AM.

The Reward: If the work is done by 10:30 AM, the rest of the day is 100% free (Gaming, Park, TV). No nagging.

The "Gap Zap": If a day is missed due to a trip/party, do not double up the next day. Skip it.

2. 🏫 The "School Paper" Trap
Don't accidentally use the same mock papers at home that the teacher uses in class.

Action: Email the class teacher this week:

"Hi, we are doing some practice at home. Could you let me know which past year papers (e.g., 2019, 2022, 2023) you plan to use in class so we don't duplicate them? Thanks!"

3. 📉 The "Fade Out" Timeline
Train independence so they don't panic when you aren't there in the exam hall.

February: Sit Together. Read questions together, discuss answers immediately.

March: In the Room, But Silent. Be present, but say: "Try to solve it yourself first. I'll help at the end."

April: The Ghost. You are in a different room. They manage the timer. They come to you when finished.

4. ✍️ The "Marker's Nightmare" Check
External markers work fast. If they can't read it, they mark it wrong.

[ ] The Number 0 vs 6: Do they look different?

[ ] The Number 1 vs 7: Is the '1' just a straight line?

[ ] The Decimal Point: Is it a clear dot . and not a faint speck?

[ ] Stamina: Can they sit for 45 mins without getting up? (Practice this on Saturdays in April).

🛑 The "Silly Mistake" Checklist
(Print this part, cut it out, and stick it on the desk next to the Question Book)

BEFORE I say "I'm Finished", did I...?

[ ] Check the Units: Did the question ask for £ or p? cm or m?

[ ] Count the Boxes: Did it say "Tick one" or "Tick two"?

[ ] Re-Read the Question: Did I answer the actual question, or just the first part?

[ ] Show My Working: If I got the answer wrong, will I still get 1 mark for the method?

[ ] The "Sensible" Test: Does my answer look right? (e.g., A car cannot be 3cm long!)
